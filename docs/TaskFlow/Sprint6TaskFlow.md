# Sprint 6 Task Flow

This document outlines the recommended implementation sequence for Sprint 6 tasks to ensure dependencies are respected and work progresses smoothly.

## Foundation Tasks (Infrastructure)

1. **Task S6.1**: Create Employer Directory Structure
2. **Task S6.6**: Initialize Employer Create Model
3. **Task S6.11**: Initialize Employer Edit Model

## Employer Creation Implementation

4. **Task S6.2**: Design Employer Create Form
5. **Task S6.3**: Implement Employer Name Input
6. **Task S6.4**: Implement Company Vision Input
7. **Task S6.5**: Implement Tech Stack Input
8. **Task S6.7**: Implement Form Submission Handler
9. **Task S6.8**: Implement Employer Creation Logic
10. **Task S6.9**: Create Admin Visibility Controls

## Employer Edit Implementation

11. **Task S6.10**: Design Employer Edit Form
12. **Task S6.12**: Implement Employer Update Logic

## Employer Delete Implementation

13. **Task S6.13**: Design Employer Delete Confirmation
14. **Task S6.14**: Implement Employer Delete Logic

## UI Enhancement Flow

15. **Task S6.15**: Update Index Page Hero Section
16. **Task S6.16**: Update Index Page Feature Sections
17. **Task S6.17**: Add Visual Elements to Index Page

## Filter Panel and Admin Control Enhancements

18. **Task S6.18**: Redesign Jobs Filter Panel
19. **Task S6.19**: Redesign Employers Filter Panel
20. **Task S6.20**: Relocate Admin Controls to Filter Panels

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Dependencies**: Tasks within each section can generally be implemented in the order listed
2. **Parallel Work**: Different sections can be worked on in parallel by different team members
3. **Testing**: After each task, verify functionality works before moving to the next task
4. **Integration Points**: Pay special attention when connecting:
   - UI components to PageModels
   - PageModels to Services
   - Admin controls to visibility logic
5. **Atomic Commits**: Each task should be committed separately with clear reference to the task ID

## Critical Path Tasks

These tasks are on the critical path and should be prioritized:
- **Task S6.1**: Create Employer Directory Structure (foundation for all Employer pages)
- **Task S6.6**: Initialize Employer Create Model (required for Create functionality)
- **Task S6.11**: Initialize Employer Edit Model (required for Edit functionality)
- **Task S6.20**: Relocate Admin Controls (affects multiple parts of the UI)

## Risk Mitigation

- Complete UI design tasks before implementing functionality
- Test admin visibility controls thoroughly as they affect multiple pages
- Verify service integration early to catch any issues with data persistence
- Ensure consistent styling across all new and modified UI elements
